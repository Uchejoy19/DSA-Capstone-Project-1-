11. **Shipping Costs vs. Order Priority Evaluation**
12. - Evaluated whether fast or Economical should match urgency and level of orders
      
    **Observation**: High-cost methods (e.g., Express Air) are often used for low-priority orders.
     A large number of orders especially low and medium orders were shipped using Express Air which is Expensive.

    Apparently, some urgent priority orders were shipped using trucks, which happened to be the slowest means and also contradicts the goal of the business.

    This shows that the company did not consistently optimize shipping in relation to urgency. Therefore, the company in order to better align shipping methods should
    - Reduce shipping cost for the goods that are not urgent
    - Improve delivery performance for urgent orders by ensuring they are always shipped usingmetter means.

    **Recommendation**: Align shipping methods with order priority to reduce costs.
     Automated shipping rules should be implemented in the order processing system to enforce the right method based on priority.
