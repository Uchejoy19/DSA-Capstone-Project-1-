#### Shipping Costs vs. Order Priority Evaluation

   ### Observation
   - High-cost methods (e.g.Express Air) are often used for low-priority orders.
   - A large number of orders especially low and medium orders were shipped using Express Air which is Expensive.
   - Apparently, some urgent priority orders were shipped using trucks, which happened to be the slowest means and also contradicts the goal of the business.
   - This shows that the company did not consistently optimize shipping in relation to urgency. Therefore, the company in order to better align shipping methods should
   - Reduce shipping cost for the goods that are not urgent
   - Improve delivery performance for urgent orders by ensuring they are always shipped using metered means.

### Recommendation:
   - Align shipping methods with order priority to reduce costs. Automated shipping rules should be implemented in the order processing system to enforce the right method.
